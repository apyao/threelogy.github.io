We drove eighty kilometers up north for JM and Marilen’s engagement shoot. The funny thing is, not one of us have any idea on what the final video output should be. We talked it over a bottle of cold Minute Maid and a few sticks of Marlboro reds then decided to: shoot in a few locations and do very short interviews.
The shoot started a bit on the serious and tight side, until the two got the hang of it and became comfortable. JM and Marilen’s kakulitan started surfacing, then it was all out fun. The interviews, as mentioned earlier, were very short. But in that very short time the two shared (a glimpse of) their story with us, one thing was clearly evident – Baby Ram changed the game and is now the number one priority. :)
