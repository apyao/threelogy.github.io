Oliver is the third in the Kaw family whose wedding we shot, making us their family’s official videographers, and he is also widely regarded as the most adventurous, the most outgoing and the “bad boy” among the three.
Jenica is the beautiful “nerdy-girl-next-door”. She lived and breathed books and considered having high grades as the quintessential gauge on the meaning of life.
The two met and their adventures began.
This is their love story. :)
