Mike & Karol didn’t feel the need to get married as they both feel secure in their relationship. But after 14 years of being together in love, they realized & decided the day has come for them to seal the deal & bring their relationship to the next level. :)
Having just 20 of their family & closest friends made it even more special. There was not a dry eye in the group. Everyone was beaming with happiness for the lovely couple.
Let’s watch their beautiful, intimate wedding we filmed in Beverly Hills, USA.
To Mike & Karol, we are honored to be a part of your big day, thank you for choosing us! Here’s to more years of love & happiness! Cheers! :)
